**He was ‘Da Coach’ of the legendary 1985 Super Bowl Champion Chicago Bears.**

Immortalized on ‘Saturday Night Live’, Mike Ditka wasn’t the winningest nor the most inspirational coach in NFL history but he was most certainly the most famous and controversial. First aired on Fox Sports West, Mike Ditka – Beyond the Glory presents a candid look at the roller-coaster career of this twentieth-century sports icon. Never one to back down from… well – anything, Coach Ditka pulls no punches in a lengthy first-person interview conducted at his Chicago eatery. ‘Iron Mike’ guides us through his tutelage under coaches Halas and Landry, his struggle to control his game time emotions, his bitter feud with defensive coach Buddy Ryan, the delirious highs and crushing lows of that nearly undefeated 1985 Super Bowl season, his failure to repeat that win followed by his humiliating firing by an ‘in-law’ owner for whom he had no respect.

The documentary also includes interviews with Ditka’s family, friends and Bear management along with key members of the team that is often referred to as the best in NFL history. (Although Miami Dolphin fans might have a problem with that).
