**BET’s groundbreaking documentary program *American Gangster* has earned a rare mix of critical praise and popular acclaim. This series of one-hour episodes reflects on the life and times of American criminals.**

One of them – Willie Lloyd, was known on the west side of Chicago as the ‘undisputed king of the Unknown Vice Lords until he was cut down by rival gang members. The attack left Willie paralyzed from the neck down and barely able to speak. Interviews with social workers, attorneys, gang members, police, as well as with Willie and his wife weave a strong cautionary tale of growing up fast and hard on the brutal inner city streets.
