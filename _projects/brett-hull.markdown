**Born to a NHL legend and a professional figure skater, Hall-of-Famer Brett Hull had the ultimate hockey pedigree. So – for that matter – did his three brothers but only Brett, the ‘happy-go-lucky slacker’, had the talent, fortitude and resilience to emerge from the shadow of his dad Bobby – nicknamed ‘The Golden Jet’ – and establish a legend of his own.**

Brett Hull, Beyond the Glory is an unusual portrait of a gifted athlete who had to overcome success in order to achieve his dream. The biography includes interviews with current and former NHL greats including Wayne Gretsky and Mike Modano.

Writer/producer Chris Mortensen grew up rooting for the Chicago Blackhawks and the day he spent with Bobby Hull – beginning with a morning interview followed by a lunch filled with hockey stories that drifted into the evening – marked an unforgettable experience.
