This one-hour documentary on the legendary rodeo bull was an episode of Fearless originally aired on the Versus network. Mortensen had done a doc on the bull’s most famous victim – champion rider Tuff Hedeman for TNN a few years before so he already knew about Bodacious, the fear he stuck in a cowboy’s heart and the havoc and mayhem he brought to the ring.

For _Bodacious_, Mortensen spent a couple of weeks traveling the back roads of Texas talking to stock breeders, bullfighters and cowboys to compile the true legend of ‘the unrideable yellow bull’.
