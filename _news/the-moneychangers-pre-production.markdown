Our latest documentary project kicks into gear.


April 2014 marks the start of our newest project: _The Moneychangers_, a feature-length documentary film that for the first time addresses and examines the viability, legitimacy and fairness of our current financial system. The film will include interviews with economic historians, leading financiers, philosophers, politicians, religious leaders, entrepreneurs and the man-on-the-street to provide a provocative, informative and controversial examination of this highly charged, largely misunderstood topic.
